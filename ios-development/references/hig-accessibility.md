# HIG and Accessibility

Apple reviews against these; users feel them. Treat this as the quality
floor, not polish.

## Layout

- Touch targets ≥ **44pt** (both dimensions, including tap padding).
- Content inside safe areas — `.ignoresSafeArea()` only for backgrounds.
- 8pt spacing grid (8/16/24/32/40/48).
- Primary actions in the thumb zone (bottom half); destructive actions
  away from habitual tap positions.
- Flexible layouts from iPhone SE (375pt) to Pro Max (440pt on the 16/17
  Pro Max; 430pt on 14/15) and landscape where supported — no hardcoded widths.

## Typography and Dynamic Type

- System text styles (`.largeTitle` … `.caption2`) — they scale free.
  UIKit: `preferredFont(forTextStyle:)` +
  `adjustsFontForContentSizeCategory = true`.
- Custom fonts must scale: `Font.custom(_:size:relativeTo:)` /
  `UIFontMetrics`.
- Support up through accessibility sizes — layouts reflow (stack
  horizontally→vertically via `@Environment(\.dynamicTypeSize)`), text
  never truncates the meaning away. Minimum 11pt.
- Hierarchy via weight and size, not colour alone; SF Symbols scale with
  text (`.imageScale`, symbol text styles).

## Colour and Dark Mode

- Semantic system colours: `.primary`/`.secondary` text,
  `Color(.systemBackground)` hierarchy
  (`systemBackground → secondary → tertiary` for layering).
- Custom colours: asset catalog with Any/Dark variants (and
  high-contrast variants for key surfaces) — dark mode is designed, not
  inverted.
- Contrast ≥ 4.5:1 normal text, 3:1 large text and UI components.
- One accent colour for interactive elements — interactivity stays
  recognisable.
- **Never colour-only information** — pair with icons, text, or shape.

## VoiceOver and Assistive Tech

- `.accessibilityLabel()` on every icon-only control; `.accessibilityHint`
  where the result isn't obvious; `.accessibilityValue` for adjustable
  state.
- Group related elements (`.accessibilityElement(children: .combine)`);
  order with `.accessibilitySortPriority` when reading order ≠ visual
  order.
- Hide decorative images (`.accessibilityHidden(true)`).
- Honour system preferences: Reduce Motion
  (`@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion)` disables decorative
  animation), Bold Text, Increase Contrast.
- Every gesture has an alternative path (swipe actions also in a context
  menu; drag also via buttons). Works with Switch Control and Full
  Keyboard Access.

## Gestures

Standard gestures with standard meanings; custom gestures are
discoverable extras, never the only path. **System gestures are sacred**:
edge back-swipe, home indicator, notification/control-centre pulls.

## Navigation Conventions

Tab bar for 3–5 sections, visible throughout drill-down (no hiding on
push). No hamburger/drawer menus. Large titles on primary screens,
inline on detail. Modality is for focused, completable tasks — not a
navigation substitute.

## Permissions and Privacy UX

- Request **in context**: the camera prompt appears when the user taps
  the camera feature, never in onboarding.
- Pre-permission explanation (your own UI) before the one-shot system
  dialog; usage-description strings in Info.plist are specific and
  honest.
- ATT (tracking) prompt only when there's real value to explain; denial
  fully respected — features don't degrade out of spite (review
  rejection territory).
- Offering third-party/social login? App Review Guideline 4.8 (revised
  Jan 2024) requires an *equivalent privacy-focused* login option as well
  (limits data to name + email, allows a private relay email, no ad
  tracking without consent). Sign in with Apple satisfies it and is the
  usual choice, but is no longer strictly mandatory. Core features usable
  without an account where feasible.
- One-shot location: `LocationButton`/`CLLocationButton` over a
  standing permission.

## Pre-Ship Checklist

- [ ] 44pt targets; safe areas; 8pt grid; SE→Pro Max + landscape
- [ ] Dynamic Type to accessibility sizes; no truncated meaning
- [ ] Dark mode intentional; contrast passes; no colour-only info
- [ ] VoiceOver labels/order; Reduce Motion/Bold Text honoured
- [ ] Gestures have alternatives; system gestures untouched
- [ ] Tab/navigation conventions; state preserved across tabs
- [ ] Permissions contextual with explanations; ATT denial respected
